# Priority-Queues

This repository contains the code for three different implementations of a Priority Queue: unsorted, sorted, and heap. 
Every entry in each Priority Queue consists of a <key, value> pair. The key is an integer and determines the priority of the entry. Keys that are greater result in higher priority entries. 

When an entry is popped from the Priority Queue, it will be the entry with the highest priority key, not the value.

Operations:
-----------
  ### Unsorted: ###
  - empty O(1)
  - size O(1)
  - push O(1)
  - pop O(n)
  - top O(n)
  - print
